    * Personal experiences (mental illness, family history)
    * Attitudes towards mental health

        As a Machine Learning Engineer at NeuronInsights Analytics, you've been contracted by a coalition of
        leading tech companies including CodeLab, QuantumEdge, and SynapseWorks. Alarmed by rising burnout,
        disengagement, and attrition linked to mental health, the consortium seeks data-driven strategies to
        proactively identify and support at-risk employees. Your role is to analyze survey data from over 1,500 tech
        professionals, covering workplace policies, personal mental health history, openness to seeking help, and
        perceived employer support.
                    
        ### Project Objectives:
        * **Exploratory Data Analysis**
        * **Supervised Learning**:
            * *Classification task*: Predict whether a person is likely to seek mental health treatment (treatment column: yes/no)
            * *Regression task*: Predict the respondent's age
        * **Unsupervised Learning**: Cluster tech workers into mental health personas

        ### 🚫 Cluster 5: Detached Dismissers  
        This group largely **denies** mental health impacts at work and shows little interest in seeking help.  
        They’re mostly unaware of leave or support policies and have rarely, if ever, received treatment.  
        Although some receive **mild support** from peers, engagement with mental health systems is minimal.  
        Predominantly younger professionals, they appear disconnected or indifferent to the broader mental health conversation.

        ### ⚖️ Cluster 6: Conflicted Strugglers  
        Many here have received treatment before, but currently hesitate to seek help possibly due to burnout, skepticism, or distrust.  
        They’re confused about policies like **anonymity** and **leave benefits**, and their workplace support is inconsistent.  
        Some coworkers and supervisors are helpful, while others aren’t.  
        This group is mentally aware but emotionally drained, cautious, and trying to find stable ground in a mixed support system.
